# goal

Qove is an endearing, light-hearted retro RPG/FPS.

The core gameplay consists of dodging slow-moving projectiles that have been lobbed at you,
and launching instantaneous raycasted attacks of your own.

Featuring a minimalist combination of low-poly primitives and 8bit pixel art, Qove immerses
you in a clifftop village inhabited by well-meaning -- if somewhat clueless -- characters.
